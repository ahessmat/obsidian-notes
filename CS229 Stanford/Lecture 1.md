Some software problems are hard to programmatically derive; those same problems are made easier through applying a learning algorithm.

Ng's goals for the course:

1. Convey enthusiasm of the material
2. Student application to original problems

# What is Machine Learning?

Defined by Arthur Samuel (1959). Machine Learning: field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

> Well-posed Learning Problem: a computer program is said to *learn* from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improvs with experience E.

-Tom Mitchell

# Supervised Learning
We provide the algorithm a dataset that is appropriately labeled. The algorithm, in turn, learns the association between the inputs and the outputs to predict more correct answers.

## Regression Problems
A variable we're trying to predict is a along a continuous value (e.g. housing prices vs. square size).
## Classification Problems
Predicting a **discrete** value as opposed to a **continuous** one.
