## Data Collection

The process begins with `data collection`, gathering raw information from various sources. This might involve capturing user interactions from web applications as `JSON` logs streamed via messaging queues like `Apache Kafka`, ingesting structured transaction records from `SQL` databases like `PostgreSQL`, pulling sensor readings via `MQTT` from IoT devices, scraping public websites using tools like `Scrapy`, or receiving batch files (`CSV`, `Parquet`) from third parties. The collected data can range from images (`JPEG`) and audio (`WAV`) to complex semi-structured formats. The initial quality and integrity of this collected data profoundly impact all downstream processes.
